# Smart Garden Planner Example

This example demonstrates a basic garden planning tool that recommends plants and watering schedules based on climate and rainfall information. It uses a small sample plant database (`plant_data.json`).

## Usage

```bash
python garden_planner.py --climate temperate --sunlight "full sun" --soil loamy --rainfall 5
```

The script will output recommended plants and a simple watering schedule adjusted for weekly rainfall.
